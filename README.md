# OPD-Open-Project-DIVA-
A mod of Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Arcade Future Tone which adds more vocals through the "mdata" folder.

NOTE: This mod may cause conflicts with other mods. This can be fixed by lowering the number of the "M" folder.
Intel sprites will glitch out with this mod causing them to become green and black. Trying to find out the cause right now.


INSTRUCTIONS TO USE: Copy the "M995" folder into your "mdata" folder. It will work after that when you start the diva.exe file.

ON USE: If you use this mod in a video, you have to credit the mod in the description and link this GitHub repository.

Thank you to everyone who helped me on this project.
